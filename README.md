The program has 2 modes:

Encryption/decryption.:

The program can encrypt and decrypt text using a given cryptographic key.

The program gets the path to a text file with the source text and creates a file with encrypted/unencrypted text based on it.

Cryptanalysis by brute force method:

The program can crack encrypted text transmitted as a text file.

In brute force mode, the program needs to add a second path to the template file, after analyzing which, the program will independently, by iterating, pick up the key and decrypt the text.

The program works with the English alphabet. The remaining characters are ignored.

The selection of the function, the input of the path, key and file for analysis is carried out through the graphical interface.



This work it is the final project for the Java Syntax module from JavaRush.ru
